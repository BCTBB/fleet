Fleet is pleased to sponsor food for your community meetup! Fleet will purchase a gift card based on expected attendance for food for your meetup. If time allows, we will also send you some stickers to share with the group. 

We ask that it be clearly stated that Fleet provided food and that no alcohol be purchased with the funds; soft drinks are okay. If you'd like to read a short blurb about Fleet (or a Fleetie is in attendance and you want to allow them a few minutes), great, but you're not obligated to do so. 

Please provide 30 days advance notice for your event. Your group is allowed one (1) sponsorship per calendar year.

_Fleet values diversity and strives to ensure our sponsorships support inclusive and accessible events. Please take measures to make your event welcoming and accessible to a diverse audience._
