# `schedule`: the Fleet cron job machinery

Fleet has several pieces of functionality that are implemented as cron jobs, which run on a
schedule. Package `schedule` implements the machinery needed for queueing and running these jobs.

## List of cron jobs

See [cmd/fleet/cron.md](../../../cmd/fleet/cron.md) for a list of the currently implemented cron jobs.
