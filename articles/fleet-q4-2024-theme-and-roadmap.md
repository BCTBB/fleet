# Fleet's Q4 2024 roadmap and theme: built-ins

Check out this [YouTube video](TODO) to watch Fleet's Head of Product Design walk through Fleet's Q4 roadmap.

Over the course of 2024, Fleet has added the "bare metal" features that let you customize whatever you need for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and iPadOS: [CIS Benchmark policies](https://fleetdm.com/guides/cis-benchmarks), [custom OS settings](https://fleetdm.com/guides/custom-os-settings) (configuration profiles), [scripts](https://fleetdm.com/guides/scripts), and [software](https://fleetdm.com/guides/deploy-software-packages). 

In Q4, Fleet is adding a layer of easy-to-use features, that are built into the product, on top of these low-level features: built-in software ([Fleet-maintained apps](https://fleetdm.com/guides/install-fleet-maintained-apps-on-macos-hosts#basic-article)) and built-in [controls and policies](https://fleetdm.com/queries).

As Fleet continues to add these built-ins in Q4 and beyond, the "bare metal" features aren't going anywhere. Fleet will always let you customize whatever you need for these OS's.

What else is Fleet working on in Q4? In addition to built-ins, Fleet is adding...
- ðŸ¦¾ "bare metal" features for Android management
- ðŸ“Š features to reach mission critical parity: see MDM command queue (activity feed), mapping end user data to device from IdP (human-device mapping), and more
- ðŸ™‹ promises and feature requests from our current customers
- ðŸ’– small UX wins that make the Fleet product love-able
